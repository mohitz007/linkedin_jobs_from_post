266,"Every time I open Linkedin, I see professionals from tech/management backgrounds write about how students graduating in the pandemic are incredibly resilient and the pandemic has prepared them for any possible workplace pressure and why they would make fantastic assets to the organization. To be really frank, this romanticization of struggle and pain is just so upsetting. Students graduating in 2020 and 2021 are anxious, depressed, incredibly stressed, dealing with isolation and persisting uncertainty. We are literally hanging by a thread. People who can, ought to be hiring/helping/mentoring graduating batches because its the kind and responsible thing to do during a global pandemic - not to derive some utility from them and capitalise on struggle.\n\nEdit : Didnt expect such an overwhelming response, for so many people to resonate with what I thought was a personal frustration.

In the first year, I discovered that I dont have any interest in ECE. I decided to work hard and get my branch changed to CSE.\n\nSecond year - I was a newbie in programming.

297,"#TechTuesday\nDr. Rajagopalan & team at IIT Madras have found a way to digitally restore blurry and indistinct pics, affected by rain, motion, haze, etc. Their Image Processing & Computer Vision Lab is using artificial neural networks to restore degraded images.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have developed a deep learning network that decomposes the restoration task into two stages: degradation localization and degraded region-guided restoration. Our premise is to use the auxiliary task of degradation mask prediction to guide the restoration process. We demonstrate that solving this auxiliary task injects crucial localizing ability in network layers. We transfer this ability to the main restoration network using attentive knowledge-distillation and focus on the refinement of degraded regions by exploiting this additional knowledge,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Dr. Rajagopalan.\nFor more visit: ",0

342,"Heres a simplified timeline for those applying to Masters Programs for Fall 2022 from Gradvine\n\n1. Start GRE prep by March/April. Give the first attempt by May-June. The number of attempts does not matter. Always leave room for multiple attempts.\n\n2. University selection: Have an idea about universities to target before the GRE itself. GRE shouldnt fully dictate your university choice.\n\n3. Have your final GRE score by August 2021 latest. Finish GRE before starting application documents.\nJuggling GRE+college/work+applications gets taxing\n\n4. Start your SOP: Solid application documents take 45-60 days to prepare. Start working on them by mid-August latest.\n\n5. TOEFL/IELTS: Finish your TOEFL/IELTS in the months of August-September. Straightforward exams so this can be done in parallel to application completion.\n\n6. Submit your Application: Submit your application early to improve chances. Not later than November 2021.\n\n7. Expect University decisions by January-April-2022.\n\n8. Secure your loans by May 2022 & appear for visa interview by June-July-2022.\n\n\nNo one has ever regretted starting early! The time you lose will never come back. While Ive given you milestones, these are the latest dates by which you should ideally get things done. Starting early makes the process easier. """,0

347,"My IIT-JEE rank was in the 3000s. This got me branches I hadn\t heard of before. Between deep sea drilling engineering in Kharagpur 3000 kilometers away from home and Computer Science in NIT Calicut literally 20 minutes down the road, I picked up the latter.\n\nBut in my head, it was a step down. I (stupidly) wanted the IIT tag. So, I was never happy at NITC. In 4 years, I came out not learning much.\n\nFor many of my friends though, NITC was an achievement. They were happy to be there and wanted to learn. They made the best of the opportunities they got. Eventually, they did well, became great developers, and some went to places like Stanford. Some of my friends in NIT did far better in life than my \xe2\x80\x9cimaginary\xe2\x80\x9d IIT self.\n\nIf you are a startup, it is tempting to hire from IITs and IIMs. But then, they may want to be in Google or a Goldman. Ask yourself, are you what these guys aspire to be in? If not, consider hiring the guys who are happy to join you, like what you do, who want to learn, and are motivated to do well with what they got. This will pay off massively.\n\n\n\nPS: Some of the best engineers in our team are from relatively obscure colleges.\n\nPS2: While making a JD, please consider removing that ""Must be from Tier-1/Tier-2 college"" line.

Would a company hire someone they know would be going on maternity leave in 7 months. Imagine my surprise when Mehul Bhati Hr calls up not only to congratulate me, but also to say take care of yourself and we will take care of you, when you join us. That call, showed me what it meant to be an employee or rather a member of Marico. Even after I joined, Hr continued to show me this amazing culture. They delayed my induction market visits, so I could go after my first trimester. Even during covid, unlike some companies with a vague directive on whether you should come to office, often leaving employees split between what is expected and a risk of exposure, Marico was clear that safety was first. During this one year, the company has taken so many initiatives like sessions on preventive measures during covid, tie ups for vaccination, tie ups for mental and physical well-being etc. My bar for good culture was high having worked in Coke, but Marico takes it to a new level.

GRE shouldnt fully dictate your university choice.\n\n3. Have your final GRE score by August 2021 latest. Finish GRE before starting application documents.\nJuggling GRE+college/work+applications gets taxing\n\n4. Start your SOP: Solid application documents take 45-60 days to prepare. Start working on them by mid-August latest.\n\n5. TOEFL/IELTS: Finish your TOEFL/IELTS in the months of August-September. Straightforward exams so this can be done in parallel to application completion.\n\n6. Submit your Application: Submit your application early to improve chances. Not later than November 2021.\n\n7.

However, my colleague kept persisting. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is too much to do and there isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFinally, since it was already 7:30 pm, I told him, \xe2\x80\x9cWithout my express permission, nobody will stay in the office after 8 pm. Now, pack up and leave right away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe problem was not that we did not have enough time, but that people needed to better understand the process. And at 2 am in the morning, you can\xe2\x80\x99t understand anything -- nobody can.\n\nUnless you are running the fire force, ambulance service, or the police, if you are working at 4 am, there is a 90% chance that you have mismanaged things in the day.\n\nThe solution is to use your day thoughtfully instead of running around distractedly, submerged in non-stop emails, meetings, and calls.\n\nInstead of slogging at night, fix your day.\n\n*** ",0

Students graduating in 2020 and 2021 are anxious, depressed, incredibly stressed, dealing with isolation and persisting uncertainty. We are literally hanging by a thread.

If work life balance is important to you, learn and earn work life balance. Your career is a 40 year long journey. Don\t start optimising too early. ",0
